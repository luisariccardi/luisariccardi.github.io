    <h1> San Francisco: the best and the worst </h1>
    <h2> The best neighborhood: Japantown </h2>
    <body> 
    <p> Meet Friendly people, enjoy the Cherry blossom fairs, try new japanese specialty food and shop at the local stores </p>
    <h2> The worst neighborhood: Mission bay </h2>
    <p> All buildings look almost the same, very modern but you don't find a specific identity, most of the stores are empty </p> </body>
